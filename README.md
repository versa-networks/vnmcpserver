## About

This MCP server is specifically designed for querying the Versa API server. It exposes a subset of Versa API resources that can be queried through the MCP (Model Control Protocol) specification, which is still a work in progress.

**Note**: The MCP specification is currently missing many security checks. Please use this within a secured environment with trusted tools only.

## Prerequisites

This server uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) for Python package management and installation.

## Setup

### General Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `uv sync` to synchronize dependencies

### STDIO Mode Setup

1. Install the project:
   ```
   uv run mcp install main.py
   ```

2. Modify `mcp.conf` with appropriate values for your environment

3. Copy the configuration file to the appropriate location:
   - For Claude Desktop: Place in the designated config directory
   - For other applications: Deploy according to your application's requirements

### SSE Mode Setup

1. Modify `mcp.env` with appropriate values

2. Source the environment file:
   ```
   source mcp.env
   ```

3. Run the SSE server:
   ```
   uv run main_sse.py
   ```

4. Configure your Claude Desktop by setting the following in `claude_desktop_config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "Versa API Server": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   This uses [mcp-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) to connect to the remote SSE server.

## Security Warning

This implementation of the MCP specification is missing many security checks. Please use this within a secured environment with trusted tools only.
